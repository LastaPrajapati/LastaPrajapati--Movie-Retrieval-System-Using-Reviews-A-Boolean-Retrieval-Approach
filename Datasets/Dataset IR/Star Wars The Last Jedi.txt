
In a galaxy far, far away, for the past 40 years, the Rebel Alliance has kept destroying the evil Empire’s First Order’s big toys. But the Supreme Leader is still convinced a crushing victory is just around the corner. Really, mate, it’s time to negotiate. You’re not getting any younger or prettier.

Luke Skywalker has turned hermit on a remote planet that just happens to be where the Jedis began. Apparently no-one thought to look for him there until Rey, a woman of unknown parentage but with a strange affinity with the Force, arrives to coax him back into the fight.

Meanwhile, the First Order fleet is chasing the rebel mothership in a sort of low-speed space car chase. (You’ll need to stifle your technological questions – such as, later, why a galactic superpower that can build a planet-melting death ray has such trouble breaking down a single blast door, or how speeders can fly for so long without apparently getting anywhere.)

Otherwise, this is a pacy, witty film that creatively expands the storyworld while still keeping the fans happy. It has an emotional resonance – heightened by Carrie Fisher’s last turn as Leia – and even asks a few questions about who really benefits from the war.
