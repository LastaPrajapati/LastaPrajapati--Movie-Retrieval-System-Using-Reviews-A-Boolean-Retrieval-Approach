Ethan Hunt and his slightly creaky IMF crew are on the trail of some plutonium before it finds its way into the hands of terrorists called The Apostles. They’re an offshoot of a group formed by Ethan’s old adversary Solomon Lane. No, I couldn’t remember their history either: it might be worth renting the last M:I film, Rogue Nation, before seeing this.
Lane is currently in custody, but for how long, eh?
What follows is a chase around the globe to the usual M:I recipe, but with the added complexity of multiple players that, in one scene at least, left me a little uncertain about who was shooting at whom.
On the upside, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie delivers plenty of visceral action and genuine tension. And when Ethan gets his arse kicked in an early fight, we start to wonder whether Ethan might finally be getting vincible (yes, it’s a word).
If this does turn out to be Tom Cruise’s swansong in the lead role, though, it wouldn’t be a bad way to finish.
