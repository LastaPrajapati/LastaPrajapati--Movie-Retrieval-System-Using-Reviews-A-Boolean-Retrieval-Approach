Mae works in cubicle hell until she lands a job at social media giant Goocle. I mean The Cirgle. No, one more go: The Circle. It helps that she has a highly placed friend there, of course, but that’s the power of social media, eh? Actually, no, it’s the power of having friends IRL. (In Real Life. Do keep up.)

She’s soon swept up in the culture of relentless cheerfulness and hipness (and top-notch healthcare benefits) while the company finds more and more fun ways to embed itself in the fabric of society. Mae, after swigging the “Secrets are Lies” corporate Kool-Aid, even agrees to wear a bodycam that streams her life in every waking hour.

But she also meets a mysterious colleague who is concerned about the company’s direction. As if The Circle would ever abuse its huge influence!

Based on Dave Eggers’ excellent and still highly relevant 2013 book, though with a different ending (he co-wrote the screenplay too), this unfortunately highlights the problem of adapting a novel that has no real antagonist or physical threat. It just lacks tension. It’s more social commentary than gripping story. Good cast though. 6/10
