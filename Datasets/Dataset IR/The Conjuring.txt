The Perron family move into a large and run-down house – a deceased estate – in 1971 and discover that the deceased owners seem not to have moved out yet. Clocks stop, doors creak, things go bump in the night, various Perrons get thumped in the night, etc. Tired of being demonised, they call in demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren. Usual haunted-house shenanigans ensue.

This is supposedly based on a true story, which possibly explains why things don’t get too extreme. In fact it’s a bit slow at times, the script is somewhat clunky, and the lack of a central character makes it hard to engage with. But it does have a few chills for those who like their horror retro-flavoured.
