“My mother sculpted me from clay, and I was brought to life by Zeus,” Diana (aka Wonder Woman) explains at one point. Her mum, as well as being a top-notch potter, happens to be the queen of the Amazons – fighty women who live on the island of Toughmascara (OK, Themyscira).

The island exists in its own bubble of time and reality, insulated from the world’s woes (and weather), but then American pilot Steve crashes his plane into it and introduces everyone to WWI. Typical man.

Diana decides this conflict must be the work of Ares, god of war. She joins Steve on a mission to stop a fiendish scientist called Dr Poison from unleashing a weapon that will derail the impending Armistice.

What unfolds is a fairly standard superhero plot, but raised above the average by its wit and by Gal Gadot, playing a woman trying to make sense of the world she’s trying to save, sexism and all. There’s also a hint of genre subversion here. “I wish I could tell you that it was one bad guy to blame,” Steve tells her. “It’s not. We are all to blame.” Too, true, Steve, whatever our action movies – and politicians – try to tell us. 7/10
